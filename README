This dataset was obtained by the team of Center for Neurocognitive Research (MEG Center) of Moscow State University of Psychology and Education as part of a study of vowel perception and their properties properties in children (Fadeev et al., 2024). In this dataset, we included MEG recordings from 35 children with autism spectrum disorders and 39 typically developing children.

Experimental procedure:

The participants were instructed to watch a silent video (movie/cartoon) of their own choice and to ignore the auditory stimuli. The stimuli were delivered binaurally via plastic ear tubes inserted into the ear channels. The tubes were fixed to the MEG helmet in order to minimize possible noises resulting from their contact with the subject’s clothing. The intensity was set at a sound pressure level of 90 dB SPL. The experiment included three blocks of 360 trials, each block lasting around 9 minutes with short breaks between blocks.

Stimuli:

The experimental paradigm used in the present study is identical to that described in Orekhova et al. (2023). We used the four types of synthetic vowel-like stimuli previously used by Uppenkamp et al. (2006) and downloaded from ‘http://medi.uni-oldenburg.de/members/stefan/phonology_1/’. Five strong vowels were used: /a/ (caw, dawn), /e/ (ate, bait), /i/ (beat, peel), /o/ (coat, wrote) and /u/ (boot, pool).
270 stimuli of each of the four classes were presented, with three stimulus variants equally represented within each class (N = 90). All stimuli were presented in random order. Each stimulus lasted 812 ms, including rise/fall times of 10 ms each. The interstimulus intervals (ISI) were randomly chosen from a range of 500 to 800 ms.

Dataset content:

database/sub.../ses-vowels/meg/...meg.fif ---- 3 runs (in some cases the number of runs may differ due to the subjects' features). MEG data were recorded using Elekta VectorView Neuromag 306-channel MEG detector array (Helsinki, Finland) with 0.1 - 330 Hz inbuilt filters and 1000 Hz sample frequency.

database/sub.../ses-vowels/anat/ ---- contains T1-weighted images MRI.
